Feature: List shows on the playwright profile

  As a user
  I want to see all shows by a playwright

  Background:
    Given I am on the English language home page

  Scenario: After creating a show that lists a profile as the primary author the show should display on that profile page
    And a profile with the following fields:
      | name | My Favorite Playwright |
    And I am logged in
    And I go to the "show" add page
    And I fill in ".show-name-edit" with "A Play About Maryam"
    And I fill in ".show-about-edit" with "Most popular name in the Arab world (2015) (BabyCenter Arabia members)"
    And I fill in ".show-author-name-edit" with "My Favorite"
    When I click on "ul.autocomplete-results li"
    And I click on ".edit-show-save"
    And I click on ".show-author"
